                <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
                <p>Edward, Siyabulela, Rangani, Rooi, and Tshepang make up a close-knit team of young men who first
                    crossed paths while studying IT at university. They share a strong interest in all things tech and
                    decided to come together to tackle a challenging project for their coursework: creating an online
                    platform for ordering food. Each one brings something unique to the table.
                    Edward is the coding guru, turning lines of text into the functional heart of their website.
                    Siyabulela has a keen eye for design, making sure the site looks inviting and user-friendly.
                    Rangani, Rooi, and Tshepang join forces to
                    manage the project, with Rangani handling organization, Rooi bringing marketing flair, and Tshepang
                    keeping a watchful eye on the budget.
                    These five friends are united by a common dream â€“ to revolutionize the online food industry. They
                    work tirelessly, pooling their IT skills and creative thinking to craft a website that offers a
                    delightful experience for both food enthusiasts and restaurant owners. Together, they make a
                    formidable team, dedicated to their shared goal of making food accessible at the click of a button.
